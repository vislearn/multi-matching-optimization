Why pylibmgm?
-------------
Pylibmgm contains state-of-the-art solvers for Graph Matching and Multi-Graph Matching problems,
wrapped in an easy to use Python interface.

For Graph Matching, we provide the dual Fusion Moves solver [2]_. For Multi-Graph Matching, we provide GREEDA [1]_, 
our newest solver which prompted us to create to this package.

In contrast to other competitor algorithms, our solvers:

- can handle *sparse costs*
- directly apply to *incomplete problems*
- guarantee *cycle-consistency* (Multi-Graph Matching)

This allows them to scale to problems with hundreds of nodes and objects.

For details, please refer to the respective publications [1]_ and [2]_.
